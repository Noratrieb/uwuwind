//! this implements the stuff necessary to get the uwutables for actual

//!
//! for this we need a DWARF parser and a DWARF call frame information
//! interpreter (yes, that shit is basically a programming language).
//! See https://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF5.pdf ยง6.4 for more information if more information is desired.
//! Note that https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/ehframechpt.html
//! contains more details on the precise format, which is slightly different
